Prediction_Assignment_Writeup_Assignment

Goal : The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the people did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. We could use any of the other variables to predict with. We should create a report describing how we built our model, how we used cross validation, what we think the expected out of sample error is, and why we made the choices you did. We will also use the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

Data: The training data for this project are available here:

The test data are available here:

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

Peer Review Portion: The submission for the Peer Review portion should consist of a link to a Github repo with my R markdown and compiled HTML file describing my analysis. Due to the constrain the text of the writeup to < 2000 words and the number of figures to be less than 5. It will make it easier for the graders if I submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online.
